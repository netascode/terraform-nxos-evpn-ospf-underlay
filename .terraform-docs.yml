  # Terraform NX-OS EVPN OSPF Underlay Module

  This module can manage a Nexus 9000 EVPN fabric underlay network based on OSPF.

  The following assumptions have been made:

  - IP unnumbered is used on all fabric links
  - OSPF area 0 is used for all interfaces
  - PIM sparse mode is enabled on all interfaces
  - A system MTU of 9216 is configured on all devices
  - All spines act as a PIM Anycast RP
  - Each leaf is connected to each spine with a single link
  - The same consecutive range of interfaces is used on all leafs for fabric links
  - The same consecutive range of interfaces is used on all spines for fabric links
